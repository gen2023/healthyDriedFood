MOD_JCHMODESWITCHER="JCH Optimize Mode Switcher"
MOD_JCHMODESWITCHER_DESCRIPTION="This module provides an easy interface to toggle the JCH Optimize Pro plugin on and off along with an integrated cache plugin. The cache will be deleted when the plugins are switched off and a new cache key will be generated when switched back on. This allows site users to easily place their site in 'development' mode so changes can be made, including changes to CSS and JavaScript files and these changes will be easily seen when placed back in 'production' mode."
